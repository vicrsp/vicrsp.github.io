## About me

I am a Control and Automation Engineer who graduated from UFMG. I have a Data Science specialization, a Master’s degree in optimization at UFMG ([PPGEE](https://www.ppgee.ufmg.br/)) and I am currently  pursuing my doctoral degree at TU Wien ([Institute for Energy Systems and Thermodynamics ](https://www.tuwien.at/mwbw/iet)) as part of the MSCA Doctoral Network [CESAREF](https://www.cesaref.eu). My research focuses in how optimization and machine learning can be combined to make industrial processes energy-efficient and sustainable.  

With 10 years of experience in Industrial IT and Data Science, I have practical experience with machine learning, optimization, and software engineering/architecture applied to the steel and mining industries. Solid skills in Python, C#, Web development (HTML/CSS/React/Typescript), SQL, operations research, mixed integer linear programming (MILP), non-linear optimization, and machine learning. Strong presentation, communication
and project management skills.
